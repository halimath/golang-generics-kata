# Sample Solution

This directory contains a go module as a sample solution for the challenges
given in the repo's root.

See the go example tests in [`seq_test.go`](./seq_test.go) for examples showcasing
how to use this library.

See the tests corresponding to the benchmarking examples given in the repo's 
`README` for a benchmark comparison of using this module vs. solving it with
_idiomatic_ go:

* [`example1_test.go`](./example1_test.go)
* [`example2_test.go`](./example2_test.go)
